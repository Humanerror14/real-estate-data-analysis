# 🏠 Data Analytics for Real Estate Investment

This project was completed as part of Coursera's "Data Analysis with Python" final peer-reviewed assignment.  
It explores real-world housing data from King County, USA, using Python and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze the data types and structure of the dataset
- Perform data cleaning and descriptive analysis
- Visualize housing price trends using seaborn
- Build regression models (Linear & Ridge)
- Apply polynomial features and pipeline techniques
- Evaluate model performance with R²

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used is `kc_house_data.csv`, containing over 21,000 real estate listings.

## 📊 Techniques Applied
- `.dtypes`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
- `seaborn.boxplot()` and `regplot()`
- `LinearRegression` and `Ridge` models
- `Pipeline` with `PolynomialFeatures` and `StandardScaler`

## 📈 Sample Output
